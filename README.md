# Adidas-Sales-Analysis
Technology used in this analysis project is Tableau. The data has 13 columns and approximately 10000 rows. I cleaned the data first then load it in Tableau Public for visualization and analysis. 
In this project I have done analysis on Adidas US sales. The objective was to find where the maximum sales is coming from & what to improve in the company to increase the sales & which area need
more focus of teams and helping in making strategic plans for future.
